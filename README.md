  - Make sure you add it in your `webpack.config.js` (Replace `name` with your `filename`)

    ```javascript
    plugins: [
        ...
        new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
            template: 'src/name.html',
            inject: 'body',
            filename: 'name.html'
        }),
        ...
    ],
    ```

- Add images to your `src/assets` folder
- Add sass files to `src/scss` folder

  - Make sure you import the scss file in `main.scss`

    ```sass
    @import "filename";
    ```
